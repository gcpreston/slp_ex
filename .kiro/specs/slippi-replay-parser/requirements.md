# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Slippi replay parser for Elixir that can parse .slp files generated by Project Slippi for Super Smash Bros. Melee. The parser will extract structured game data including match metadata, player information, frame-by-frame game state, and computed statistics. The implementation will be designed with modularity in mind to support both file-based parsing and future streaming protocol integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to parse .slp replay files into structured Elixir data structures, so that I can analyze Super Smash Bros. Melee match data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid .slp file is provided THEN the system SHALL parse the file and return structured game data
2. WHEN an invalid or corrupted .slp file is provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error information
3. WHEN parsing is successful THEN the system SHALL return data structures containing match metadata, player information, and frame data
4. IF the .slp file version is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a version compatibility error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to match metadata and player information, so that I can identify games and participants without processing frame data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing match metadata THEN the system SHALL extract game start information including stage, players, and game settings
2. WHEN parsing player data THEN the system SHALL extract character selection, player tags, controller ports, and player types
3. WHEN parsing game settings THEN the system SHALL extract stage selection, game mode, and match rules
4. IF metadata is incomplete THEN the system SHALL return partial data with clear indication of missing fields

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to frame-by-frame game state data, so that I can analyze detailed gameplay mechanics and player actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing frame data THEN the system SHALL extract pre-frame and post-frame data for each active player
2. WHEN processing player states THEN the system SHALL include position, velocity, animation state, and input data
3. WHEN handling frame sequences THEN the system SHALL maintain proper frame ordering and handle rollback frames
4. IF frame data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL skip invalid frames and continue parsing valid data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want computed statistics and derived data, so that I can access common gameplay metrics without manual calculation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL compute basic match statistics like stocks, damage dealt, and match duration
2. WHEN calculating player metrics THEN the system SHALL include action counts, movement data, and interaction statistics
3. WHEN processing game events THEN the system SHALL identify kills, deaths, and significant game state changes
4. IF statistical computation fails THEN the system SHALL return raw data without computed statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular parsing components, so that the same logic can be reused for streaming protocol implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the parser architecture THEN the system SHALL separate binary parsing logic from file I/O operations
2. WHEN implementing data structures THEN the system SHALL use shared modules for both file and stream parsing
3. WHEN processing binary data THEN the system SHALL use reusable functions that work with binary chunks
4. IF extending to streaming THEN the system SHALL reuse existing parsing logic without duplication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that I can reliably process .slp files of varying quality and versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering parsing errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with context
2. WHEN validating file format THEN the system SHALL verify .slp file headers and structure
3. WHEN handling version differences THEN the system SHALL support multiple .slp format versions gracefully
4. IF partial parsing is possible THEN the system SHALL return available data with error details for failed sections

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient memory usage and performance, so that I can process large .slp files and multiple files in batch operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing large files THEN the system SHALL use streaming binary parsing to minimize memory usage
2. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL support concurrent parsing operations
3. WHEN handling frame data THEN the system SHALL provide options for selective parsing of specific data sections
4. IF memory constraints exist THEN the system SHALL offer lazy loading options for frame data
